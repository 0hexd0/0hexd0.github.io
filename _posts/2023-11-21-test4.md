You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

$$
R_{\mu \nu} - {1 \over 2}g_{\mu \nu}\,R + g_{\mu \nu} \Lambda
= {8 \pi G \over c^4} T_{\mu \nu}
$$

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`    CUSTOMER {
            string name
            string custNumber
            string sector
        }


Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

``` ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "你好, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
